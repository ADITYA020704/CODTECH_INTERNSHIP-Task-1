 OVERVIEW OF PROJECT-

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on the World Happiness Report involves a systematic approach to understand, visualize, and summarize the key characteristics of the data. Here is an overview of the steps you can follow:

   STEPS  INVOLVED-

# 1. Define Objectives and Questions
Objective: Understand the factors influencing happiness across different countries.

Questions:
What are the distributions of happiness scores across countries?
Which factors (e.g., GDP, social support, life expectancy) are most strongly correlated with happiness?
Are there regional differences in happiness scores?
How have happiness scores changed over time?
# 2. Data Collection
Obtain the World Happiness Report data from official sources, such as World Happiness Report,Kaggle or github.
# 3. Data Understanding
Data Overview: Examine the structure of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns, and types of variables.
Initial Observations: Look for any immediate patterns or outliers.
# 4. Data Cleaning
Missing Values: Identify and handle missing values appropriately (e.g., imputation, removal).
Duplicates: Check for and remove duplicate records.
Inconsistencies: Resolve any inconsistencies in data (e.g., different formats for country names).
# 5. Data Transformation
Feature Engineering: Create new features if necessary (e.g., regional classification based on countries).
Normalization/Scaling: Normalize or scale the data if required for analysis.
# 6. Exploratory Data Analysis
Univariate Analysis:
Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
Visualizations: Histograms, box plots.
Bivariate Analysis:
Correlation analysis.
Scatter plots, pair plots.
Multivariate Analysis:
Heatmaps to visualize correlations between multiple variables.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and pattern recognition.
#7. Visualization
Geographical Visualizations: World maps showing happiness scores by country.
Trend Analysis: Line plots to show changes in happiness scores over time.
Bar Charts: Comparisons of happiness scores across regions or top/bottom countries.
# 8. Hypothesis Testing
Perform statistical tests to validate hypotheses (e.g., ANOVA to compare happiness scores across regions).
# 9. Insights and Interpretation
Summarize key findings and insights from the data.
Discuss the implications of the results.
# 10. Reporting
Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the EDA process, findings, visualizations, and interpretations.
Include an executive summary for stakeholders.

# Tools and Libraries
Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn.

Jupyter Notebook: For an interactive analysis and visualization.
